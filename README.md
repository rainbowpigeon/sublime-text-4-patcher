# sublime-text-4-patcher
Python 3 patcher for Sublime Text v4107-4152 Windows x64

Credits for signatures and patching logic goes to https://github.com/leogx9r

- Uses signatures instead of hardcoded offsets
- Automatic version detection for stable/dev channels
- No host blocking needed
- Enter any text as license
- Disables crash report telemetry
- Disables phoning home

## Requirements

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

or just

```pip3 install pefile```

It's just for `pefile` which is indirectly used for version detection.

## Usage

```python3 sublime_text_4_patcher.py```

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to enter any text as the license key afterwards! For stable versions, you can accomplish this by going to Help > Enter License.
